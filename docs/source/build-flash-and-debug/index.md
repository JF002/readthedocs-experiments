### Setup
The documentation is written in Makrdown (.md) files and generated using the Sphinx documentation generator.

First, we need to install Sphinx and its dependencies:
 - `myst-parser` : add support for markdown files
 - `sphinx_rtd_theme` : theme from ReadTheDocs
```
pip install sphinx
pip install myst-parser
pip install sphinx_rtd_theme
```

### Build the doc
Run the following command in the folder `docs`
```
sphinx-build -b html ./source ./generated
```

Then display the doc by browsing to `generated/index.html` using your favorite web browser.
